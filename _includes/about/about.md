Hi 👋,  
I am Qiongqiao, Zhangqq😋, an automobile CAE engineer.

My major is structural [durability]() for full vehicles, and minor in structural [NVH](), structural [crashworthiness]() , [CFD](), and effort to [multi-object optimization]() for vehicles and [secondary development]() for CAE softwares.

In recent years, I'm strong interesting in [autonomous driving](), and trying to get [Deep Learning]() into CAE analysis.

**Welcom to talks:👇**
- CAE&CFD etc. simulation
- Software Development
- Self-driving cars
