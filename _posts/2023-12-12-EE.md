So Mary, I heard you were thinking about doing a triathlon?  
That's right. But you know triathlons are tough with the three events: swimming, then cycling, and finally running. My sister, Jennifer, did a triathlon last year and loved it. So, I decided to give it a try.  
Good for you. I did my first triathlon back in college six years ago. Now I do at least one triathlon every year. It keeps me fit and healthy with regular swimming, cycling and running. So, do you have a favorite of the three events?  
Yes, definetely running, I start running back in high school and loved it. I woke up six a.m. every morning, and then ran three miles. Now I'm training for the triathlon I'm loving waking up at six a.m. and running agin.  
Not me, running is my worst event. I get bored when I run. I start daydreaming about other things and forget where I'm going. Two times last week, I made a wrong turn and almost get lost.  
For me, it's swimming, swimming pools are fine, but triathlons... take place in lakes. And... I'm scare that the giant fish will eat me.  
What? Come on, there aren't any giant people-eating fishin lakes, and even the small fish will be scared away when hundres of people from the triathlon are swimming there all at the same time.
